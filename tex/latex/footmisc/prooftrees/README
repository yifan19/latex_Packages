This package supports drawing proof trees of the kind often used in
introductory logic classes, especially those aimed at students without strong
mathemtical backgrounds. Hodges (1991) is one example of a text which uses
this system. When teaching such a system it is especially useful to annotate
the tree with line numbers, justifications and explanations of branch
closures. 

prooftrees provides a single environment, prooftree, and a variety of tools
for annotating, customising and highlighting such trees. A cross-referencing
system is provided for trees which cite line numbers in justifications for
proof lines or branch closures.

prooftrees is based on Forest and, hence, TikZ. The package requires version
2.0.3 of Forest for expected results and will not work with version 1.

The author is certain  that some of her beliefs are false, but sure that her
belief that prooftrees has bugs is not among them.
